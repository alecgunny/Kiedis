proceeded to plead fathers help me decide A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye I turned around and found that i was still alive Snakes rise high from the purple black sky The red cloud rains and the black horse rides Then it dawned on my like the mornin' sun I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes Glowing embers tend to remember when The power that is peace was treated as a friend I am a master of and i've got to take action I'm a man, the animal man  Down the street you can hear her scream &quot;you're a disgrace&quot; As she slams the door in his drunken face And now he stands outside And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool He cries &quot;oh girl, you must be mad What happened to the sweet love you and me had&quot; Against the door he leans and starts a scene And his tears fall and burn the garden green And so castles made of sand, Fall in the sea eventually A little indian brave who before he was ten Played war games in the woods with his indian friends And he built a dream that when he grew up He would be a fearless warrior indian chief Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow He would sing his first war song And fight his first battle but something went wrong Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand Melts into the sea eventually There was a young girl whose heart was a frown Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound And she wished and prayed she would stop living So she decided to die She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore And to her legs she smiled &quot;you won't hurt me no more&quot; But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say &quot;look a golden winged ship is passing my way&quot; And it really didn't have to stop It just kept on going And so castles made of sand Slips into the sea eventually  You jump in front of my car when you, You know all the time that Ninty miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain You say you just want me to take you for a ride You're just like crosstown traffic So hard to get through to you Crosstown traffic I don't need to run over you Crosstown traffic All you do is slow me down And I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run Tire tracks all across your back I can see you had your fun But darlin' can't you see my signals turn from green to red And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead You're just like crosstown traffic So hard to get through to you Crosstown traffic I don't need to run over you Crosstown traffic All you do is slow me down And I got better things on the other side of town  I've got a soul That can not sleep At night when something Just ain't right Blood red But without sight Exploding egos In the night Mix like sticks Of dynamite Red black or white This is my fight Come on courage Let's be heard Turn feelings Into words American equality Has always been sour An attitude I would like to devour My name is peace This is my hour Can I get Just a little bit of power The power of equality Is not yet what it ought to be It fills me

along just like they do in Budapest On the rise You be the shark (shack) And baby I'll be the desert There is nothing to like When there is nothing to measure It's all our space  Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss I watched the waves come in, Roll in, roll out, without a single doubt Lone on the bluff, is there ever enough I stare into the air, somewhere out there, The family affair, bring home the night There I know that you turn off the light The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life She gave me the love, she gave the love Coming up short and I’m sad to report, with us invite tonight Your kiss, my kiss, another day to waste Lovers don’t miss, when they can’t even face a plot that has a twist To share, my prayer, I need my baby bed, Come home tonight Whoa There I know that you turned off the light The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life There I know that you turned off the light The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life Love of my life There I know that you turned off the light The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life There I know that you turned off the light The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life

truth Left the backdoor swinging Like a dirty little sleuth The truth is I have never Felt half this alive Now it’s time to dance Upon the grave called 45 Jacked up on some Kerouac And surely bullet proof The girl who taught me what to do Was missing her front tooth Gentle as a storm Inside your mental health I wanna find the answer But I just can’t find myself I say so long To the way I played The way I played Inside of yesterday Hey let’s run around The great escape From out of my hometown Later I would look for love Inside a woman’s dorm A couch to keep me humble And her breath to keep me warm Ophelia was the girl That I was feeling for Come to realize It was me who was the whore A captain lost himself Inside a 40 year old skull The drink of choice was knowledge And we always wanted more Drunken sailors Seeking their Geronimo Instead they found the things That they really didn’t wanna know I say so long To the way I played The way I played Inside of yesterday Hey let’s run around The great escape From out of my hometown Country roads Would never let me stay The way I played Inside of yesterday A devil’s growl and cat’s meow Were blended into one Termites called suburbanites Were eating all the fun A juggernaut of comedy And blasphemy I wanna stop the madness But I think it has to be I say so long To the way I played The way I played Inside of yesterday Hey let’s run around The great escape From out of my hometown Country roads Would never let me stay The way I played Inside of yesterday Hey let’s run around The great escape From out of my hometown  I’m afraid that I’m never afraid I’ve got combat boots And I’m American made For your eyes girl Mormon lover on a delicate day Gonna marry the boss Get carried away War cries girl I’m not immune to Canadian snow Now teach me everything That I should know With your eyes girl Freeze on the radio I’ve got to leave and more Freeze on the radio I’ve got to bleed into snow Hold on Let go We know Do you shine like a temple inside Can I open your core So gentle and wide Like your eyes girl Rack ‘em up stretch ‘em out When they’re tight This acetylene torch is giving me sight War cries girl Black and blue from the hullabaloo Do the caribou bite When they look into you And your eyes girl  In love dying There’s a flawless rain In love dying One foot in the astral plane Someone’s sighing There’s a virgin road Waiting to be strode Rope’s untying This power I could not withhold Satisfying What do we contain Can’t stop crying These tears of change Remain the same My girl she shoots down The baddest of guys She knows that they Want me dead She fires up the starry night And fills them so full So full of lead In love dying Does it go two ways In love dying This body I can not detain Wake up flying She the solar shores Passers buying The memories we readorn In love dying Nothing to obtain In love dying No crawling thru The halls of fame In love dying Loss becomes the gain In love dying Recreate me So I may sustain  Death Let me catch what's left Let me see what's left Let me see what's true Do I really want to Run from my depths Will I have regrets Will I ever find you Will I ever find words That give me motive to express Bread Will I go unfed Will I be the one who rushed on in To where angel fear to tread Was it me who bled On the new death bed And there is no fear When you're leaning on love Those grateful dead Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove The ending, the must Chess Let me play my rest When I do regress Let it all unwind To the board unless Less I second guess Look into the sky Where we all comply With something higher than the Rest my love, sail through   Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove The ending, the must Sky all around Fell to the ground Now I'm a child Stayed for a while Flesh Is it meaningless But we all protest To the last request Is there anything you could now suggest Did I do my best Did I leave it better Even though we look to be Just mildly obsessed with you Sail through Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove The ending, the must Someone like you To be there  Love is all the world You say the world is gone Love is all the world You say it's gone I don't The party in your eyes Says someone to caress A party in the sky I think I'll wear a dress God saves us all and tell us how it ends Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times Work and play all day until the sun is high Haley and the comets sang an old rock jam The ukulele play another song I'll brag God saves us all and tell us how it ends Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends Stole a lot from Peter Cause had to pay your Paul And when you find that's not enough He'll break your fall Some get on and some Get off the carousel I think it's time to go So I will fare thee well God saves us all and tell us how it ends Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends Stole a lot from Peter Cause had to pay your Paul And when you find that's not enough He'll break your fall  This is the kitt, I can't compare A delicate new arrival Check the commute I do declare Lets sing a new revival Chemical circus at the pub Mentally she's departed Cut me a check I'll cut your rug Later we'll get bombarded 'Cause everybody knows The game is full of highs and lows Like your mother said Girl your father is dead Everybody knows That life is full of highs and lows Is there always red In your wedding bed Everybody knows Officer please I just got there Traveled from door to door Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair What are we looking

Hanalei A simple song and it made me cry I really don’t want to pass me by A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway The revolution in your blood creates the wave I picked her up on the road to surf Looked a lot like a mother earth She said hello my name is Charlotte Gray, hey Make it safe for someone else to find their faith I’m away I’m away... Hanalei  So we were down in Brazil and, man, that place is wild. We were in Rio de Janeiro, and uh, we had this, this sort of, uh, security-guard type guy, and he was supposed to take us around and say hey, could, you know, could you take us to the, the favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the, you know, the street life of your town, and he said sure, so we, we pull up to this hooker, and she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual, and he says &quot;Get over here!&quot; and she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted. Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say &quot;Hey, what's up, girl?&quot; Get out of bed and I clear up my head and I don't want to go but I do it instead We all dream within a dream  Get into bed and I turn off my head, and I﻿ started to float but I sunk when she said, &quot;we're all dreams within a dream&quot; So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson, painted green, and... Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter--the rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights, and, well, you know, we smoked weed and we'd go up in the hills and we'd listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and... well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music, and, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star--I didn't even know what that was, I was like, whatever you wanna do, man, I'm coming with you. I'm right with you, my friend.  Get out of bed and I clear up my head and I don't want to go but I do it instead We all dream within a dream  Get into bed and I turn off my head, and I﻿ started to float but I sunk when she said, &quot;we're all dreams within a dream&quot; (La la la...) Why in the world would you want it to be--why would you wanna take it so... so literally?  All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head, make you stop and wonder why--ah!  Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me?  I don't think so  I reach out to my family and I say  It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, oh It's about heaven in your heart  Now when shall we start?  I wanna choose love instead of fear Won't you come right now over here and be a part of my...

brain is where I bleed. In sanity it seems, Is got me by my soul to squeeze. Well all the love from me, With all these dying trees I scream. The Angels in my dreams, have turned to demons of greed, That's me. Where I go I just don't know, I got to, got to, gotta take it slow. When I find my piece of mind, I'm gonna give you some of my good time. Today loves smile on me, It took away my pain, said please All that you ride is free, You gotta let it be, Oh ya. Where I go I just don't know, I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow. When I find my piece of mind, I'm gonna give you some of my good time. You're so polite indeed, Well I got everything I need. Oh make my days a breeze, And take away my self destruction. It's bitter baby, And it's very sweet. I'm on a rollercoaster, but I'm on my feet. Take me to the river, Let me on your shore. I be coming back baby, I be coming back for more. Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone, ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad, like an apple gift but i went out and never said my pleasures I'm much better but I won't regret it never Where I go I just dont't know, I got to, got to, gotta take it slow.
